/*
Problem Statement
Clumsy Factorial
The clumsy factorial of a positive integer n 
is obtained by applying a fixed rotation of operations, including
multiplication '*', division '/', addition '+', and subtraction '-', 
to the integers in decreasing order. The operations are applied according to 
the usual order of operations in arithmetic, where multiplication and division 
are done before addition and subtraction.
For example, the clumsy factorial of n = 10 is calculated as follows:
clumsy(10) = 10 x 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 x 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 x 1.
We use floor division for 
the division operation, meaning the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
Your task is to implement a 
function that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the clumsy factorial of n.
